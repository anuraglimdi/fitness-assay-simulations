# fitness-assay-simulations
Jupyter notebooks where I play around with parameters for fitness assays for TnSeq, and find parameters which improve fitness estimation

Basically playing around with population genetic parameters, and trying to figure out how much sequencing depth, bottleneck size, etc. is necessary to get a desired
precision of fitness estimates
